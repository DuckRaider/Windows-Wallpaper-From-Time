# Windows-Wallpaper-From-Time
For some reason, you can't change the Windows wallpaper according to the local time. <br>
This program creates a directory where you can save your wallpapers which will be set as your background depending on your systems time. Just call the images files like:
- ```night.extension``` -> set wallpaper between **22:00** and **7:00**
- ```morning.extension``` -> set wallpaper between **7:00** and **10:00**
- ```day.extension``` -> set wallpaper between **10:00** and **18:00**
- ```evening.extension``` -> set wallpaper between **18:00** and **22:00**

The program creates a directory called 'backgroundChangerTimeImages' where the '.exe' is saved. Save your wallpapers there.
